# Gist Viewer

Small Node.js app for viewing and favoriting gists from GitHub

## Running the app

### Docker Compose



## Time Spent

I admittedly used a lot more time than the allotted 2 hours.  In total I think I spent about 4 hours total on the project. This was essentially my first time digging into Node.js, so I spent a bit of time researching and figuring out how I wanted to structure the app. I also was a litle confused on the requirements and mistook "Favorite" with the GitHub "Star" terminology, so after I reread the requirements, I went back and refactored a bit.
